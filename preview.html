        <p>As of 2025-11-20, newcomers and employers across Canada are navigating fast-changing immigration policies that affect permanent residence pathways, temporary work and study options, and international travel planning. This newsletter highlights Canada's 2026–2028 Immigration Levels Plan, a key provincial route to permanent residency in New Brunswick, practical guidance on Canadian work permits and German business travel, and a brief overview of the U.S. immigration medical exam for readers with cross-border interests.</p>

<h2>Navigating the USCIS I-693 Immigration Medical Exam and Related Waivers</h2>
<p>For U.S. immigration applicants, Form I-693, completed by a USCIS-designated Civil Surgeon, is an essential part of many green card applications. The exam focuses on communicable diseases of public health significance, required immunizations, and medical conditions that may make an applicant inadmissible under U.S. immigration law.</p>
<p>This is not a general annual physical and does not include routine preventive screening such as cholesterol or kidney function tests. Applicants should arrange a separate regular check-up, which is often covered by insurance, while the immigration medical exam usually is not.</p>
<ul>
<li>The exam typically includes a medical history, physical examination, tuberculin testing (or chest x-ray if needed), blood tests for syphilis and gonorrhea (where applicable), and a review of vaccination status and admissibility.</li>
<li>Applicants must bring a printed, single-sided Form I-693, vaccination records if available, valid photo ID, and payment for the exam and form completion.</li>
<li>A follow-up visit is usually required to review lab results, complete vaccinations, and have the Civil Surgeon sign and seal the I-693 envelope, which must remain unopened for USCIS.</li>
<li>The latest I-693 edition (version dated 01/20/2025, effective 7/3/2025) must be used to avoid rejection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vaccination rules follow CDC guidance and are tailored to age, including vaccines such as Tdap, MMR, Varicella, Influenza, and Hepatitis B. If records are missing, applicants may undergo immunity testing or receive vaccines based on medical advice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical waivers for vaccines (for example, during pregnancy or where contraindications exist) can be granted directly by the Civil Surgeon.</li>
<li>Religious or moral waivers require filing Form I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility, directly with USCIS.</li>
<li>Waivers involve extra fees, and applicants should bring a detailed health history for proper evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain applicants who are otherwise inadmissible due to specific medical grounds, vaccine refusals based on religion or morals, or other listed inadmissibility reasons may apply for a Form I-601 waiver. This application usually includes evidence of extreme hardship to qualifying U.S. relatives, and legal advice is strongly recommended.</p>
<ul>
<li>As of 10 April 2024, a properly completed and sealed Form I-693 signed on or after 1 November 2023 has indefinite validity.</li>
<li>Applicants should normally collect their sealed I-693 from the clinic within 30 days of exam completion and submit it to USCIS within 60 days of the Civil Surgeon's signature to prevent delays or repeat testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expert civil surgeons, such as Dr. Neema Malhotra, can coordinate vaccination coverage with insurance, arrange discounted lab fees, and offer expedited, concierge-style support for lab orders, waiver consultations, and copies of completed forms.</p>

<h2>2026–2028 Canadian Immigration Levels Plan: Key Insights for Employers and Stakeholders</h2>
<p>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will publish the final 2026–2028 Immigration Levels Plan on or before 1 November 2025. This roadmap sets annual admission targets and priorities, helping employers and communities plan for future talent and population growth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Permanent resident admissions are expected to stabilize around 380,000 per year from 2026 to 2028, a modest reduction from recent peaks but still high by historical standards.</li>
<li>Temporary resident arrivals are projected to fall, with caps of 385,000 for 2026 and 370,000 for both 2027 and 2028, aiming to bring the temporary resident population below 5% of Canada's total population by 2027.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Plan emphasizes economic immigration as the primary driver of growth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Economic-class admissions are expected to account for about 64% of all permanent residents by 2027–2028.</li>
<li>Express Entry admissions should increase, especially in categories targeting in-demand occupations and candidates already working in Canada.</li>
<li>Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) targets are expected to rise, supporting provincial responses to local labour shortages, particularly in Western Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other priorities remain important in the Levels Plan.</p>
<ul>
<li>Francophone immigration outside Quebec is targeted to reach 10.5% of admissions by 2028.</li>
<li>Family reunification will remain steady at roughly 21.3%–22.1% of overall admissions, with refugee resettlement around 13%, maintaining Canada's humanitarian role.</li>
<li>One-time initiatives will help transition an estimated 115,000 Protected Persons and up to 33,000 temporary workers already in Canada to permanent resident status.</li>
</ul>
<p>System capacity remains a challenge. As of September 2025, IRCC's overall inventory exceeds 2.2 million applications, with almost one million in backlog, affecting processing times for study and work permits. New international students and temporary workers declined sharply in 2025—down by roughly 60% and 48%, respectively—due to caps, higher financial thresholds, and program reforms. This reduction is particularly difficult for sectors such as hospitality, agriculture, and construction.</p>
<p>For employers, steady permanent resident targets and expanded Express Entry and PNP pathways are positive signs, but reduced temporary resident numbers may require shifting strategies. Businesses should closely follow the final Levels Plan, explore provincial nominee options, and support candidates in moving from temporary to permanent pathways where possible.</p>

<h2>Canada's 2026–2028 Immigration Levels Plan: A Strategic Shift to Sustainable Growth</h2>
<p>The federal government's supplementary release on the 2026–2028 Immigration Levels Plan confirms a significant recalibration focused on sustainability and long-term capacity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Permanent resident admissions will stabilize at 380,000 annually from 2026 to 2028, with economic immigration rising to 64% of overall admissions by 2027–2028.</li>
<li>PNP targets increase sharply to 91,500 in 2026, up from 55,000 the year before, reinforcing the role of provinces in addressing regional labour shortages.</li>
<li>Other economic streams, such as Federal High Skilled programs through Express Entry, remain central to meeting national infrastructure and labour needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Temporary resident targets are scaled back compared with 2025.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total temporary resident admissions are projected at 385,000 in 2026 and 370,000 in both 2027 and 2028, down from 673,650 in 2025.</li>
<li>International student admissions will be reduced to approximately 155,000 in 2026, from about 305,900 earlier.</li>
<li>The Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) target will fall from 82,000 to 60,000, while the International Mobility Program (IMP) will increase to about 170,000 permits.</li>
<li>Canada aims to bring the temporary resident share of the population below 5% by the end of 2027 to ease pressure on housing, health care, and other services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Policy adjustments include tighter eligibility and caps on study permits, restrictions on low-wage TFWP positions in high-unemployment areas, and narrower spousal open work permit eligibility. These measures have already produced marked declines in new study and work permits, reflecting a pivot toward more carefully managed growth.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Plan protects integration and diversity goals by maintaining humanitarian and family streams and gradually increasing the share of French-speaking immigrants outside Quebec to 10.5% by 2028. One-time measures to grant permanent residence to around 115,000 protected persons further underline Canada's humanitarian commitments.</p>

<h2>Navigating Work Visa Applications for Canada and Short-Term Business Travel to Germany</h2>
<p>Professionals planning cross-border work or business trips must understand the different requirements for Canadian work permits and short-stay Schengen visas for Germany. Careful preparation can prevent delays, refusals, and unexpected travel disruptions.</p>
<p>Most foreign nationals who want to work in Canada require a work permit issued by IRCC.</p>
<ul>
<li>In many cases, applicants first need a valid job offer from a Canadian employer and, where required, a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) to show there is no negative impact on Canadian workers.</li>
<li>Applications typically include a passport, proof of work experience, education and, where needed, an Educational Credential Assessment, language test results, police certificates, and proof of funds.</li>
<li>Work permits can be employer-specific, open, or LMIA-exempt under certain agreements and programs.</li>
<li>Processing often ranges from 2 to 6 months, and applicants may need biometrics and a medical exam depending on the job type and country of residence.</li>
</ul>
<p>For detailed Canadian work permit information, see <a href="https://www.globalization-partners.com/globalpedia/canada/visa-permits/">Source</a>.</p>
<p>For short-term business travel to Germany (up to 90 days in any 180-day period), many travellers require a Schengen visa.</p>
<ul>
<li>Permanent residents of Canada and those with valid Canadian study or work permits can apply at the German Consulate in Canada; others must apply from their country of residence.</li>
<li>Applications may be lodged up to six months before travel, and processing usually takes at least 15 days.</li>
<li>Appointments are mandatory and are booked online; missing documents can lead to refusals.</li>
<li>Applicants must submit fingerprints and attend in person; even with a visa, final entry is decided by border officers based on security and admissibility considerations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best practices for both Canada and Germany include applying as early as possible, keeping copies of all supporting documents, following official document checklists carefully, and coordinating closely with employers or hosts to ensure accuracy.</p>

<h2>Navigating the New Brunswick Experience Stream for Permanent Residency</h2>
<p>The New Brunswick Experience stream under the New Brunswick Provincial Nominee Program (NBPNP) offers a targeted pathway to permanent residence for skilled workers already living and working in the province. It is designed for candidates who have proven their ability to integrate into New Brunswick's labour market and communities.</p>
<p>Key eligibility criteria focus on work, residence, language, education, and employer status.</p>
<ul>
<li>Applicants must hold full-time (minimum 30 hours per week), non-seasonal employment with an eligible New Brunswick employer and have at least six months of continuous work experience with that employer.</li>
<li>Candidates must have lived continuously in New Brunswick for at least six months before applying.</li>
<li>Language proficiency must meet at least Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) 4 in reading, writing, listening, and speaking, proven by an approved language test such as IELTS General Training or CELPIP.</li>
<li>Educational credentials must match the job's National Occupational Classification requirements, and foreign education typically requires a valid Educational Credential Assessment completed within the last five years.</li>
<li>Employers must be actively operating in New Brunswick, comply with labour standards, show genuine labour shortages through recruitment efforts, and be in good legal standing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The application process is structured in several stages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure a qualifying job offer from an eligible employer.</li>
<li>Submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) through the INB online portal.</li>
<li>Upon receiving an Invitation to Apply (ITA), submit a full application with supporting documents within 45 days.</li>
<li>If approved, obtain a provincial nomination certificate, valid for six months, and then apply to IRCC for permanent residence.</li>
<li>After IRCC's medical, security, and criminality checks and final approval, confirm permanent resident landing and report it via the INB portal within 30 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applicants must provide complete documentation, including language test results, proof of employment and residence, educational certificates, and certified translations for any documents not in English or French. Both the applicant and employer must ensure accuracy and honesty to reduce the risk of refusal.</p>
<p>Benefits of this stream include a direct route to permanent residence with strong provincial backing, options to include eligible family members, and the opportunity to settle long term in a province known for its welcoming communities and stable labour market. Candidates should maintain valid temporary status in Canada throughout the process and may wish to consult regulated immigration professionals for up-to-date advice.</p>

<p>Canada's current immigration moment is defined by careful balancing: stabilizing permanent resident growth while tightening temporary streams, expanding provincial and economic pathways, and ensuring system capacity keeps pace. For individuals, this means planning ahead, staying informed about program-specific changes, and using reliable official guidance; for employers and communities, it involves adapting recruitment and settlement strategies to a more sustainable but still welcoming immigration environment.</p>
